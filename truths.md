Truths I strive to live (and hope to die) by.

1. God exists and has spoken through His Son, Jesus Christ. By trusting in Jesus Christ, we can be reconciled with our Creator and saved from His wrath.
2. Never compromise on your convictions. You will never regret acting consistent with your conscience, even when your judgement at the time was wrong.
3. Speak the truth always.
4. Do not be a foot soldier in another man's war. 
5. Know when to quit the game.
6. Keep a small circle of reliable friends. Be friendly but intimate with a few. These should be people you can call on when in dire straits.
7. Always have a plan or you will be subject to another's.
8. Labor diligently.
9. Know well the condition of your flock.
