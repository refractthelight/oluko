Following my [last post](2022-09-25-ggchess-hiatus.md), I manged to make ggchess UCI-compatible and was able to get it to play on [BanksiaGui](https://banksiagui.com/).

While I did not run any rigorous assessment, I would place ggchess' Blitz rating to be between 700 and 900. Pretty poor, in my opinion. There are many known (and unknown) issues that I hope to address in the next version.

As a prototype, I would consider ggchess to have been a success. I have gotten deep into the world of computer chess and learnt a lot about representation, hashing, search algorithms (minimax, alpha-beta pruning etc.).

Here's a game between ggchess and Stockfish:
