I will be working through Bob Nystrom's [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) to create a Go implementation of lox, glox (pronounced "gloch"; see [Ch. 1:4](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html#the-second-interpreter)).

I heard many frightful stories about the compilers class in college that I never considered taking it. Implementing glox is a step in facing that fear.
